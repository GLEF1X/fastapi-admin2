# FastAPI2 Admin

### Introduction
`fastapi-admin2` is an upgraded [fastapi-admin](https://github.com/fastapi-admin/fastapi-admin), that 
supports ORM dialects, true Dependency Injection and extendability. Now it's not a production-ready library,
but it will become it.

### Key Features

* Entirely asynchronous(built on FastAPI)
* Supports a bunch of ORM dialects(currently sqlalchemy and tortoise)
* Thoughtful internationalization
* Dark mode
* Extendable and fully customizable
* Built-in authentication, authorization and AWS S3 integration
* High code quality


### TODO list
* Implement more dialects(Mongo, peewee)
* Implement auto-resolving relationships, foreign keys for `sqlalchemy` 
* Write tests to achieve 100% code coverage
* Keyset pagination
